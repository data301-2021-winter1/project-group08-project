## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are choosing to work on Cryptocurrency as a topic. Our interest on this topic is to compare Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrency's datasets to find out a pattern in price movement between Bitcoin and altcoins on the different price trends. There is a lack of understanding as to what is the reasoning behind exponential rise in prices on altcoins. Cryptocurrency has a promising future for becoming an alternative currency to the dollar but there is a lot of speculation and unknowns about what are the real usage of the cryptocurrencies. Because it is still a developing field, prices of the currencies are extremely volatile. Most of the investors who want to invest in the field choose bitcoin as an option. Bitcoin has around half of the total market cap of all the cryptocurrency and because of its big market cap it has a lot less volatility compared to the other coins and it dictates the overall status of cryptocurrencies. Looking at the previous data collected between bitcoin and ethereum we are hoping to find out a regular occurence of a same price change relation between Bitcoin and Ethereum on different price trends. With the results from this data we can make investment strategies and logical guesses for the future of the cryptocurrencies
